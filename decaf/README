Welcome to DECAF, release 1.0.

DECAF(Dynamic Executable Code Analysis Framework) is the successor to 
the binary analysis techniques developed for TEMU(dynamic analysis component
of BitBlaze) as part of Heng Yin's work on BitBlaze project headed up by Dawn Song.
DECAF builds upon TEMU. We appreciate all that worked with us on that project.
