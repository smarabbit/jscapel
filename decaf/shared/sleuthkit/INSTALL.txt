                    Installation Instructions


REQUIREMENTS
=============================================================================
Tested Platform:
- FreeBSD 2-6.*
- Linux 2.*
- OpenBSD 2-3.*
- Mac OS X
- SunOS 4-5.*


System:
- C compiler
- GNU make
- OpenSSL Libraries (www.openssl.org)


Optional Programs:
- Autopsy 2.05: Provides a graphical HTML-based interface to The
Sleuth Kit (which makes it much easier to use).  Install this AFTER
installing The Sleuth Kit.

    Available at: http://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy


INSTALLATION NOTES
=============================================================================
- If you are planning on using the Autopsy Forensic Browser with
The Sleuth Kit, then it is recommended that you make a symbolic
link from the specific install directory (i.e. sleuthkit-1.00) to a
generic directory (i.e. sleuthkit) and use that location for the Autopsy
configuration file.  For example:

    $ ln -s /usr/local/sleuthkit-1.00 /usr/local/sleuthkit


INSTALLATION
=============================================================================

The Sleuth Kit  uses basically the same installation scripts that were
written for TCT.  The process should happen automatically by typing:

    $ make

If an error occurs about not using GNU make, then either install GNU
make or type in 'gmake' if you have both GNU and BSD make installed.

The script attempts to identify if certain items on the system.  If the
script says that it can not find something, then it does not necessarily
mean that it is an error.

If you get a 'gcc: not found' error, then the compiler can not be
found (the GNU compiler is used by default).  If you only have 'cc'
installed, use the following line:

    $ make CC=cc

Or if you have gcc installed, but not you your path, use something like:

    $ make CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc

If you do not have Perl, then you can use:

    $ make no-perl

If you only want the mactime tool (i.e. the file systems tools do not
support your OS), then you can use:

    $ make mactime



All tools will be compiled into the 'bin' directory.  All manual pages
are located in the 'man' directory.  To always have access to the
manual pages, add the directory to your MANPATH environment variable.
If you would like the binaries to be placed in a common directory,
such as /usr/local/bin, then it must be done manually.


REFERENCES
=============================================================================
As much of the installation process is from The Coroners Toolkit (TCT),
much of this file is based on the original INSTALL file.
