This is basically just the normal file tar file with the install
and clean scripts added to it.  To compile for The Sleuth Kit, use
'sh TSK.install' and later 'sh TSK.clean' instead of directly using configure
and make.  Doing it directly will result in the required files
being installed in /usr/local instead of the TSK directory.
