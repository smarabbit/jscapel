/* Breakpoint manager is responsible for creation and removal of breakpoint objects.

 * the action(for example when the document is not yet loaded), breakpoint manager 
 * adds/removes into an internal list and this list is processed when breakpoint 
 * manager is requested by script debugger to process the breakpoints for a given file
 *
 * The internal map fileToBreakpointsMap is used to find a breakpoint given a file 
 * name, this is mainly used to lookup breakpoint instance given a file name and
 * line number. This is useful when script debugger wants to decide to suspend or
 * continue. Another map idToBreakpointMap is used to lookup a breakpoint given
 * the breakpoint ID. This is used when we receive update/removal command from IDE
